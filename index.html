<!-- It has at least 3 React components

A component is a function that returns JSX and components are used like they’re an HTML element

main.tsx does not count as a component, it doesn’t have a function that returns JSX

It’s displaying the test data

You can put your array of data in whatever file you want, or even in its own file

It’s using at least 1 prop on your own components

A prop is set like it’s an HTML attribute, and received as a destructured parameter property

key does not count for this, you need to come up with your own prop and practice setting it and receiving it
